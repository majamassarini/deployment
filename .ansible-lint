  # and then later to kubernetes.core collection.
  # Ansible 2.9.27 in F35 still contains the k8s module so we can ignore the error until F36,
  # where we can switch to kubernetes.core.k8s as ansible-5.x in F36 contains it.

  # Ignore until F36, where these are in community.crypto collection (part of ansible-5.x rpm).
